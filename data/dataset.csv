We had a office lunch at Cinnamon grand few weeks back and the experience wasn't five star. Our invites were shown to different seats and the hotel staff was taking breaks during the lunch and service was not done properly. I was in Taj New Delhi two weeks back and the service there was amazing. Treating all guests equally no matter what. Most of the staff in Cinnamon has attitudes. They look at most lot of the Sri Lankan guests in third degree. They should understand when it comes to hospitality the first thing is to be humble and treat everyone equally. They judge you if you mistakenly pronounce a food or beverage name wrong. They look at you sacristy if you don't know what the food is. It's there job to explain what the food is and everything in a polite way without making,Negative,"staff ,service "

It was truly a blessing in disguise because otherwise we wouldÔøΩve had to wait at the reception with all our bags. The room we checked into and a really nice view of the city. The room was super clean, everything was replaced with new items and bedding. The AC in the room was absolutely great escape from the heat outside. Right after getting our luggageÔøΩs into the room, we ordered room service as we didnÔøΩt have breakfast and the the dining staff was super quick to have hot hot breakfast delivered to our doorstep with a moveable dining table and butler like service and the finest utensils, this was really nice to see! We felt like we were fine dining but in our very own room!! We then headed to the pool for a quick dip, the pool was really well maintained and the water was just perfect to cool off the heat from the sun. Both dinner and breakfast blew us away with the amount of spread they had at the buffets. Every bit of food was just so delicious that we kept wanting to eat more. They even got their sushi and sashimi right (we are big fans). Our overall experience was an absolute bliss and will always have Cinnamon Grand at the top of our to-stay list in Colombo.

"This is my third stay here and it always gets better. It feels like a home away from home. The staff all throughout the hotel go above and beyond to help and are the kindest people youÔøΩll ever meet.
I canÔøΩt thank Bhanu, Ali and Prasanna enough for their help when I was sick. The three of you were so wonderful and IÔøΩll be forever grateful to you.

"This is our second visit to the Cinnamon Grand with the last visit in 2015. In terms of decor - nothing has changed. It is looking a bit dated but still pleasant and clean.

We opted for an Executive Room, which is on the 9th Floor and has it own lounge area and dedicated staff. The Executive lounge area has High Tea (15:00 hrs) and Happy Hour (18:00 hrs) - both being free and served by excellent staff. Shame the view is nothing special. The Executive Floor also has its own dedicated check-in, which was efficient and friendly, although they did have an issue processing an American Express card.

Rooms are ok. Nothing to rave about and now looking dated. I was disappointed that they only offer sachet coffee. As mentioned in another review - the Cinnamon Bentota provides a coffee machine with pods - what I would suggest is the minimum for a 5-star hotel. The internet is good (80-100 mb/s) but limited to 4 devices (not good for a family of four with iPads, laptops and iPhones!)

Hotel amenities are good. Lots of restaurants with the Sri Lankan (Nuga Gama) being outstanding. However, some of the restaurants are overpriced - London Grill charging UK prices of a steak!

The gym is good; however the old entrance through the side of the hotel via a walkway has been chained off, so you have to leave through the hotel lobby exit. Not ideal when returning sweaty!

Overall - this hotel is a pleasant stay. Staff are very friendly and accommodating - probably the second best we have had on this holiday (first being Cinnamon Bentota).

Would I stay here again? Yes",Positive,"Accomodation,Service,Room,Facility-gym"

What a great meal we had at the Lagoon in the cinnamon grand hotel in Colombo. Everyone of the staff was amazingly friendly and very attentive so I applaud them for that. I would also like to mention that Damith was a lovely chap so give him a raise !!,Positive,"Food,Staff"
"Very sweet man, very kind and generous. Appreciate his service. He gave us a splendid experience here at the Cinnamon Grand Coffee Stop. Thank you Mr Sanjeewa, keep up the good work. Wishing you all the very best :)",Positive,Service
"We are currently staying at the Cinnamon Grand and are already disappointed with their service. I hate to see them start bullying us when we complain or give constructive criticism of their product or service. This happened to my husband and me at the Coffee Stop and the Tea Lounge. They point us to the other staff whenever they see us coming there or passing through that. I have seen with my own eyes some show us to other guests and talk about us. This is like ÔøΩKopi KadeÔøΩ. It is disgusting and unprofessional. This indicates that they cannot take any complaints and start bullying the guest. I stopped going to Coffee Stop, Tea Lounge (for half of my stay) and, in the end, Plates because I felt very uncomfortable. I came here for a holiday, but they ruined everything. I was like in quarantine. I never wanted to go here for the holidays, but due to business commitments, we decided to come here. When we try to be friendly with everyone, they try to take advantage of us. At one point, one of the staff members commented on my appearance. It is none of his business, and it is bullying. I am not sure where HR stands in Cinnamon because, from my experience, they also do not have proper knowledge and training. Also, one of the managers told my husband that ÔøΩhe does not like coffee from a coffee stop, give him one from here (Tea Lounge)ÔøΩ. There is a way to say rather than like a waiter in a corner tea shop. Ultimately, we are guests and customers, not come here on Cinnamon credit. Hotel School staff and Managers need serious training on bullying, discrimination and customer service. When one of the female staff (Hotel school trainee) made an offensive comment about my husband, HR did not take it seriously, showing their poor knowledge. As a female, I am so ashamed that females do these types of things, and in some situations, they raise their voices at my husband. They need to know the way to talk to a guest. There are apprentices and trainees work overseas but have never seen such unprofessional trainees like from Hotel School. Also, what Managers at Cinnamon do is cover up everyoneÔøΩs mistakes rather than solving and taking necessary actions. This is not good leadership. They all need to have training from foreign trainers rather than Local trainers as they all adopt the colonial mentality. It is better to get training from a Navy Seal Commander because they always say one of the most powerful things to tell by a leader is to say, ÔøΩI screwed upÔøΩ, and then only others will learn to tell the truth.

Further, my husband saw a hair in one of the green chutneys he took, and he pointed out that to the chef. He looked at it and said this was probably from a guest and gave his plate to a junior chef. They removed the hair and gave back his plate. That is very unhygienic. He would have removed the whole plate, given the guest a new one and helped him get the food he had on his plate. Another problem in this scenario is that they are teaching the wrong strategies to the junior staff.

Also, when we pay our account via bank, it takes a week to allocate the payment even after sending the payment receipts to their email. Last time, they had no idea about our email and insisted the account was correct. So we had to waste our valuable time chasing this again, and only they managed to allocate the payment. I worked as a Financial Controller in Hospitality Industry in Australia and am an Australian CPA-qualified Accountant, so I understand how accounts work and where the inefficiency is.

In the end, we pay to get deplorable service. We never ask for free things, but some staff ask favours from us even to get trip advisor comments. Trip advisor is to give honest feedback and not force you to do, and as a guest or customer, we can provide any input based on our experience. I feel this is a cinnamon syndrome, as they force us to write good comments where we go. I have been travelling to many countries and stayed at luxury hotels such as Langham (Melbourne), Shangri La (Sydney), The Waldorf Hilton (London), Ampersand (London), Park Plaza West Minister Bridge London, Marriot (New York), Hilton (Zurich), Vijitt resort (Phuket), Minor Hotels, Westin, Ayers Rock and many more. These were not gifts; we paid for everything. We never had a bad experience, and they all showed genuine hospitality. However, I feel the staff here treat White people and Sri Lankans differently, which is discrimination. Most of the Sri Lankans who visit the hotels are scared to tell their real experience or sometimes do not understand because they get treated the same way every day. Since we stayed and lived overseas, it is easy for us to tell the difference, and we also do not accept favours from anyone. I am not expecting the same service as overseas, but at least respect their guest, treat them well during their stay and stop discriminating. Some try their best to provide that service but most do not care. We planned to have family and cousins for dinner at Plates before we returned, but they ruined all that, and we are not in the mood to do that now. We decided to stay here because we are renovating our property close to Cinnamon Grand. So, as I said before, admit you screwed up.

So do some of the members from European delegation visiting Sri Lanka whom I host there time to time love the place and drinks mixed by the bar. Hospitality is world-class just like the Kingsley the Pastry Chef here. I m dying to see one day he makes a Marshipan cake we eat in Sweden√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùalso plenty of cinnamon buns and Danish√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùEuropean way. Mangal is my favo so do Milan, Samith, Sandeepa who welcome with a smile one forgets the tiredness. They make one feels at home. The coffee lounge is one of the best in Colombo scene √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù price wise, quality snd taste wise I must say. Cinnamongrand is my kind of class- European and particularly Scandinavian.",positive,Food

"We had planned our mothers 90th birthday celebration at the Ivy Room at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo Madhu was just EXCEPTIONAL! She accommodated our every need and request. At the onset of the planning, I had taken my ""almost to be"" 90 year old mother for the first face to face meeting with Madhu, and she listened very kindly, patiently and intently to my mother's suggestions and requests and fitted them all into the planning as well. She was extremely cooperative and helped fulfill and accommodate all our. We valued and appreciated her input. She treated this event as an emotional one, as it was my mother's 90th, and I guess that said, it is a MILESTONE event. We couldn't have made this celebration the success it was, without Madu's expertise, exceptional service, professionalism and above all the kindness and empathy she put in to helping us organise this function.
Supun, the supervisor in charge on the day of the celebration, was extraordinarily efficient, professional and gave us excellent service too. He accommodated many of our requests. We had many elderly guests who attended the fuction and we needed lots of last minute requirements for them, with adjustments in table arrangements etc. Supun and his team handled this for us with a smile on their face, pleasantly - without ever making us feel like we were troubling them. We appreciated this. Other requests, small glitches and technical matters with the music & the Audio visual, were taken care of very professionally. Supun took care of the elderly guests and my mother with a lot of kind respect. These are memories that will always stay with us.
Inoka, head of the pastry room, took our order for the structured cake. We gave her our own design which was quite complicated. She took it on, with much ease, skill & mastery. She was a very pleasant person to work with. The final outcome of the cake was better than the original design and the it was super delicious.
All in all, dear Madhu and Supun & his team, and Inoka, helped us achieve our end goal, which was to give our mother a lovely celebration and make her happy. I along with the rest of my family, highly COMMEND and thank them all.

"I stayed at the CG for five days. I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and have been familiar with it since it was called the Oberoi. This was my first visit after Covid. Things I loved: The Staff- always smiling and pleasant, eager to help The Pool - big pool, long enough for some laps to burn off some holiday weight, lots of seating deck chairs and tables. Safe kids area. The Pool Bar - good choice of drinks and snacks, relaxed ambience The Coffee Stop - lobby cafe, excellent coffee and snacks including ice cream. Plenty of seating. Staff will serve you at the table even though you place orders at the counter. Reception - Helpful and prompt, they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep you waiting, Yumna was particularly helpful. In Room Dining - generous food portions, delicious and delivered promptly.

The Ambiance- plenty of weddings and festivities going on making it a thriving lobby area

Restaurant and Bar Options - plenty on site

Things I‚Äôd like changed:

The bathroom - the renovation is nice but the ventilation is poor. It‚Äôs never dry and fresh smelling unless you leave the room air con on full blast and the bathroom door open overnight. Bathroom exhaust fan is ineffective. Also the shower door didn‚Äôt seal allowing the floor to get wet every time.

Hotel cars and airport transportation - nice new upscale cars and professional drivers but the price is far too high. USD 65 for airport transfer (an Uber would be 1/4 the price). I think if the prices were lowered significantly (I mean by at least 50%) they would get more use and these cars would be going 24/7 generating revenue. In previous stays years ago I only used hotel cars for all my transportation needs in Colombo as the prices were very reasonable. It‚Äôs not feasible now.",negative,bathroom

Visited Noodles for the first time with my family to celebrate our parents' wedding anniversary. Chamath and I'm sorry couldn't get the names of the waitress and the tall waiter who served us were very kind and attentive and made our little 3 year old daughter feel home away from home by fulfilling her requirement with a kid's meal which she finished without a trace. We didn't have to follow up with the pre ordered cake as Chamath was well aware of it and served the anniversary cake to our parents as a surprise.

Also, thank you to Kasun and Tharanga for ensuring our rooms were clean everyday, as well as Ranil and Jeremy at the help desk for assisting us with whatever issues we faced.

There are many restaurants within the hotel, and unfortunately we didn't have time to try them all. The food was amazing, especially the spread at the buffet. It is an older hotel, so there are certain aspects that come with that. However, it has been well-maintained and retains a certain charm that can only be found in hotels like this, such as the live music in the evenings.

We had a office lunch at Cinnamon grand few weeks back and the experience wasn't five star. Our invites were shown to different seats and the hotel staff was taking breaks during the lunch and service was not done properly. I was in Taj New Delhi two weeks back and the service there was amazing. Treating all guests equally no matter what. Most of the staff in Cinnamon has attitudes. They look at most lot of the Sri Lankan guests in third degree. They should understand when it comes to hospitality the first thing is to be humble and treat everyone equally. They judge you if you mistakenly pronounce a food or beverage name wrong. They look at you sacristy if you don't know what the food is. It's there job to explain what the food is and everything in a polite way without making,Negative,"staff ,service "

We then headed to the pool for a quick dip, the pool was really well maintained and the water was just perfect to cool off the heat from the sun. Both dinner and breakfast blew us away with the amount of spread they had at the buffets. Every bit of food was just so delicious that we kept wanting to eat more.

"Arrived here on a Sunday afternoon in late Oct 2022, spending only one night on our tour of Sri Lanka. ItÔøΩs quite a large hotel but somehow manages not to feel large. Has a lovely pool and our 6th floor room overlooked the pool. Nice open plan bar. We had a buffet meal on the Saturday night , in the garden and weÔøΩd been recommended this by our travel agent as outstanding.It was a bit better than ok.

"Overall the hotel is beautiful and the bedrooms are quite clean too! The low rating is due to the mould build up in the showers and the poor quality food at Noodles which caused Gastro for a number of our friends and family. However a special thanks to Pradeep from Housekeeping who took really good care of us during our stay! Pradeep has a warm smile making him an approachable person, who was very detailed in cleaning/ tiding our room. Thank you Pradeep!

I was greeted with such kindness and this continued throughout my stay. Everyone loved the hotel. The rooms were clean and super comfortable, the food was amazing and The hotel staff was beyond exceptional. I must appreciate the special service of Prabath(Butler), Upeksha, Tharaka, Ali and from the top management To The lowest employee of the 9th floor. And also a special thanks to Delucian at restaurant , Wasantha and Lakshitha, Indika (Swimming pool) and Jagath(house keeping) and And to all those whose names might have forgotten.

"This is our second visit to the Cinnamon Grand with the last visit in 2015. In terms of decor - nothing has changed. It is looking a bit dated but still pleasant and clean.

We opted for an Executive Room, which is on the 9th Floor and has it own lounge area and dedicated staff. The Executive lounge area has High Tea (15:00 hrs) and Happy Hour (18:00 hrs) - both being free and served by excellent staff. Shame the view is nothing special. The Executive Floor also has its own dedicated check-in, which was efficient and friendly, although they did have an issue processing an American Express card.

Rooms are ok. Nothing to rave about and now looking dated. I was disappointed that they only offer sachet coffee. As mentioned in another review - the Cinnamon Bentota provides a coffee machine with pods - what I would suggest is the minimum for a 5-star hotel. The internet is good (80-100 mb/s) but limited to 4 devices (not good for a family of four with iPads, laptops and iPhones!)

Hotel amenities are good. Lots of restaurants with the Sri Lankan (Nuga Gama) being outstanding. However, some of the restaurants are overpriced - London Grill charging UK prices of a steak!

The gym is good; however the old entrance through the side of the hotel via a walkway has been chained off, so you have to leave through the hotel lobby exit. Not ideal when returning sweaty!

Overall - this hotel is a pleasant stay. Staff are very friendly and accommodating - probably the second best we have had on this holiday (first being Cinnamon Bentota).

Would I stay here again? Yes",Positive,"Accomodation,Service,Room,Facility-gym"

What a great meal we had at the Lagoon in the cinnamon grand hotel in Colombo. Everyone of the staff was amazingly friendly and very attentive so I applaud them for that. I would also like to mention that Damith was a lovely chap so give him a raise !!,Positive,"Food,Staff"
"Very sweet man, very kind and generous. Appreciate his service. He gave us a splendid experience here at the Cinnamon Grand Coffee Stop. Thank you Mr Sanjeewa, keep up the good work. Wishing you all the very best :)",Positive,Service
"We are currently staying at the Cinnamon Grand and are already disappointed with their service. I hate to see them start bullying us when we complain or give constructive criticism of their product or service. This happened to my husband and me at the Coffee Stop and the Tea Lounge. They point us to the other staff whenever they see us coming there or passing through that. I have seen with my own eyes some show us to other guests and talk about us. This is like ÔøΩKopi KadeÔøΩ. It is disgusting and unprofessional. This indicates that they cannot take any complaints and start bullying the guest. I stopped going to Coffee Stop, Tea Lounge (for half of my stay) and, in the end, Plates because I felt very uncomfortable. I came here for a holiday, but they ruined everything. I was like in quarantine. I never wanted to go here for the holidays, but due to business commitments, we decided to come here. When we try to be friendly with everyone, they try to take advantage of us. At one point, one of the staff members commented on my appearance. It is none of his business, and it is bullying. I am not sure where HR stands in Cinnamon because, from my experience, they also do not have proper knowledge and training. Also, one of the managers told my husband that ÔøΩhe does not like coffee from a coffee stop, give him one from here (Tea Lounge)ÔøΩ. There is a way to say rather than like a waiter in a corner tea shop. Ultimately, we are guests and customers, not come here on Cinnamon credit. Hotel School staff and Managers need serious training on bullying, discrimination and customer service. When one of the female staff (Hotel school trainee) made an offensive comment about my husband, HR did not take it seriously, showing their poor knowledge. As a female, I am so ashamed that females do these types of things, and in some situations, they raise their voices at my husband. They need to know the way to talk to a guest. There are apprentices and trainees work overseas but have never seen such unprofessional trainees like from Hotel School. Also, what Managers at Cinnamon do is cover up everyoneÔøΩs mistakes rather than solving and taking necessary actions. This is not good leadership. They all need to have training from foreign trainers rather than Local trainers as they all adopt the colonial mentality. It is better to get training from a Navy Seal Commander because they always say one of the most powerful things to tell by a leader is to say, ÔøΩI screwed upÔøΩ, and then only others will learn to tell the truth.

Further, my husband saw a hair in one of the green chutneys he took, and he pointed out that to the chef. He looked at it and said this was probably from a guest and gave his plate to a junior chef. They removed the hair and gave back his plate. That is very unhygienic. He would have removed the whole plate, given the guest a new one and helped him get the food he had on his plate. Another problem in this scenario is that they are teaching the wrong strategies to the junior staff.

Also, when we pay our account via bank, it takes a week to allocate the payment even after sending the payment receipts to their email. Last time, they had no idea about our email and insisted the account was correct. So we had to waste our valuable time chasing this again, and only they managed to allocate the payment. I worked as a Financial Controller in Hospitality Industry in Australia and am an Australian CPA-qualified Accountant, so I understand how accounts work and where the inefficiency is.

In the end, we pay to get deplorable service. We never ask for free things, but some staff ask favours from us even to get trip advisor comments. Trip advisor is to give honest feedback and not force you to do, and as a guest or customer, we can provide any input based on our experience. I feel this is a cinnamon syndrome, as they force us to write good comments where we go. I have been travelling to many countries and stayed at luxury hotels such as Langham (Melbourne), Shangri La (Sydney), The Waldorf Hilton (London), Ampersand (London), Park Plaza West Minister Bridge London, Marriot (New York), Hilton (Zurich), Vijitt resort (Phuket), Minor Hotels, Westin, Ayers Rock and many more. These were not gifts; we paid for everything. We never had a bad experience, and they all showed genuine hospitality. However, I feel the staff here treat White people and Sri Lankans differently, which is discrimination. Most of the Sri Lankans who visit the hotels are scared to tell their real experience or sometimes do not understand because they get treated the same way every day. Since we stayed and lived overseas, it is easy for us to tell the difference, and we also do not accept favours from anyone. I am not expecting the same service as overseas, but at least respect their guest, treat them well during their stay and stop discriminating. Some try their best to provide that service but most do not care. We planned to have family and cousins for dinner at Plates before we returned, but they ruined all that, and we are not in the mood to do that now. We decided to stay here because we are renovating our property close to Cinnamon Grand. So, as I said before, admit you screwed up.

The quality of food and service at the other restaurants such as The Lagoon, Noodles, Chutney and Coffee Stop were also excellent.

"We had planned our mothers 90th birthday celebration at the Ivy Room at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo Madhu was just EXCEPTIONAL! She accommodated our every need and request. At the onset of the planning, I had taken my ""almost to be"" 90 year old mother for the first face to face meeting with Madhu, and she listened very kindly, patiently and intently to my mother's suggestions and requests and fitted them all into the planning as well. She was extremely cooperative and helped fulfill and accommodate all our. We valued and appreciated her input. She treated this event as an emotional one, as it was my mother's 90th, and I guess that said, it is a MILESTONE event. We couldn't have made this celebration the success it was, without Madu's expertise, exceptional service, professionalism and above all the kindness and empathy she put in to helping us organise this function.
Supun, the supervisor in charge on the day of the celebration, was extraordinarily efficient, professional and gave us excellent service too. He accommodated many of our requests. We had many elderly guests who attended the fuction and we needed lots of last minute requirements for them, with adjustments in table arrangements etc. Supun and his team handled this for us with a smile on their face, pleasantly - without ever making us feel like we were troubling them. We appreciated this. Other requests, small glitches and technical matters with the music & the Audio visual, were taken care of very professionally. Supun took care of the elderly guests and my mother with a lot of kind respect. These are memories that will always stay with us.
Inoka, head of the pastry room, took our order for the structured cake. We gave her our own design which was quite complicated. She took it on, with much ease, skill & mastery. She was a very pleasant person to work with. The final outcome of the cake was better than the original design and the it was super delicious.
All in all, dear Madhu and Supun & his team, and Inoka, helped us achieve our end goal, which was to give our mother a lovely celebration and make her happy. I along with the rest of my family, highly COMMEND and thank them all.

"I stayed at the CG for five days. I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and have been familiar with it since it was called the Oberoi. This was my first visit after Covid. Things I loved: The Staff- always smiling and pleasant, eager to help The Pool - big pool, long enough for some laps to burn off some holiday weight, lots of seating deck chairs and tables. Safe kids area. The Pool Bar - good choice of drinks and snacks, relaxed ambience The Coffee Stop - lobby cafe, excellent coffee and snacks including ice cream. Plenty of seating. Staff will serve you at the table even though you place orders at the counter. Reception - Helpful and prompt, they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t keep you waiting, Yumna was particularly helpful. In Room Dining - generous food portions, delicious and delivered promptly.

The Ambiance- plenty of weddings and festivities going on making it a thriving lobby area

Restaurant and Bar Options - plenty on site

Things I‚Äôd like changed:

The bathroom - the renovation is nice but the ventilation is poor. It‚Äôs never dry and fresh smelling unless you leave the room air con on full blast and the bathroom door open overnight. Bathroom exhaust fan is ineffective. Also the shower door didn‚Äôt seal allowing the floor to get wet every time.

Hotel cars and airport transportation - nice new upscale cars and professional drivers but the price is far too high. USD 65 for airport transfer (an Uber would be 1/4 the price). I think if the prices were lowered significantly (I mean by at least 50%) they would get more use and these cars would be going 24/7 generating revenue. In previous stays years ago I only used hotel cars for all my transportation needs in Colombo as the prices were very reasonable. It‚Äôs not feasible now.",negative,bathroom

And of course the food, which was so delicious. It was on a Saturday and we were doubtful whether there will be time but Ravindra took the order in the most gracious way. The order was delivered on time and it was excellent. It was such kindness by Ravindra that we had a lovely evening. We wish to thank Ravindra and the hotel for everything you did. He is indeed a credit to Cinnamon Grand. More than what Ravindra did it was the way he did it that made all the difference. Thank you Ravindra. Thank you Cinnamon Grand",positive,service

Also, thank you to Kasun and Tharanga for ensuring our rooms were clean everyday, as well as Ranil and Jeremy at the help desk for assisting us with whatever issues we faced.

There are many restaurants within the hotel, and unfortunately we didn't have time to try them all. The food was amazing, especially the spread at the buffet. It is an older hotel, so there are certain aspects that come with that. However, it has been well-maintained and retains a certain charm that can only be found in hotels like this, such as the live music in the evenings. I would recommend this hotel, and will be returning when I visit Sri Lanka.",positive,"service,food,atmosphere,music,room"
